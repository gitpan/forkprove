NAME
    forkprove - forking prove

SYNOPSIS
      forkprove -MMoose -MCatalyst -MDBIx::Class -lr t

DESCRIPTION
    forkprove is a forking version of prove that allows you to preload
    modules with "-M" and then run each test after forking, potentially
    makes most of the tests to run faster without an overhead of loading the
    same modules again and again, while having an isolated, clean testing
    environment with a fork.

CAVEATS
  Test::More
    Do not try to preload Test::Builder and friends because doing so will
    not output clean TAP.

  Known patterns to fail
    Following kind of tests are known to fail.

    *   Tests that rely on the value of $FindBin::Bin.

    *   Tests that expects "END" block to run after each ".t"

WHY
    Test::Aggregate allows you to create a nested TAP output by running a
    whole bunch of ".t" files from a directory.

    forkprove shares the basic idea, but it creates a whole new test
    environment by making a copy of the process with fork for each test,
    which means it could run your tests that rely on the singleton state
    etc. without modifying the code to run with Test::Aggregate.
