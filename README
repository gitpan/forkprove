NAME
    forkprove - forking prove

SYNOPSIS
      forkprove -MMoose -MCatalyst -MDBIx::Class -lr t

DESCRIPTION
    forkprove is a forking version of prove that allows you to preload
    modules with "-M" and then run each test after forking, potentially
    makes most of the tests to run faster without an overhead of loading the
    same modules again and again, while having an isolated, clean testing
    environment with a fork.

CAVEATS

    Do not try to preload Test::Builder and friends because doing so will
    not output clean TAP.

  Known patterns to fail
    Following kind of tests are known to fail.

    *   Tests that rely on the value of $FindBin::Bin.

    *   Tests that expects "END" blockk to run after each ".t"
